## List of Challenge KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them

- **Challenge KPI 1:** Enhance .NET developers' access to Cardano blockchain.
  - Addressed by developing, open-sourcing and publishing OgmiosDotnet, a plug-and-play client library with seamless integration into .NET applications.
  - Included a Quick Start Worker application to demonstrate practical use cases and simplify adoption.
- **Challenge KPI 2:** Provide comprehensive tools and documentation for Cardano adoption in the .NET ecosystem.
  - Delivered detailed, modular documentation covering the client library and worker application setup, integration, and extensibility.
  - Published NuGet packages to ensure accessibility and encourage developer engagement.

## List of Project KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them

- **Project KPI 1:** Progressive reading of blockchain and memory pool data.
  - Implemented client functionality for slot-based blockchain data synchronization and real-time mempool transaction access.
- **Project KPI 2:** Ease of use and developer adoption.
  - Achieved with auto-generated idiomatic Ogmios schema types and Entity Framework Core for database integration.
  - Quick start example showcases seamless integration with PostgreSQL in-memory, encouraging practical application.

## Key Achievements

- Successfully developed and open-sourced OgmiosDotnet on GitHub.
- Published two NuGet packages:
  - [OgmiosDotnetClient.Services](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OgmiosDotnetClient.Services)
  - [OgmiosDotnetClient.Schema](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OgmiosDotnetClient.Schema)
- Enhanced .NET integration capabilities by enabling parallel processing for blockchain synchronization.
- Upgraded projects to .NET 9.0 for ~32% performance improvements.
- Collaborated with Demeter.Run to offer Ogmios as a service.
- Demonstrated practical blockchain usage via the Worker application, which includes database persistence.
- Introduced seamless dependency injection for Ogmios.Services:
  - Developers can integrate the services with a single line of code using the provided extension:
    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddOgmiosServices();
    ```
  - This significantly reduces boilerplate code, promoting ease of use and rapid adoption.

## Key Learnings

- **Parallel processing:** Essential for improving blockchain synchronization efficiency, reducing the processing time of historical data.
- **Documentation importance:** Clear, modular documentation is crucial for developer adoption and open-source contributions.
- **Community collaboration:** Partnering with Demeter.Run provided valuable insights for scaling blockchain services.
- **Expanding language support:** Adding Ogmios support for new languages like .NET enhances Cardanoâ€™s global appeal.

## Next Steps for the Product or Service Developed

- Seek feedback from the .NET and Cardano communities for enhancements.
- Expand features to include transaction submission and ledger state querying.
- Consider integrating a React-based UI in the Worker application for visual demonstrations.
- Explore additional Catalyst funding to maintain parity with Ogmios and extend functionality.

## Final Thoughts/Comments

I am deeply grateful to the Catalyst community for funding this initiative. OgmiosDotnet has successfully addressed a critical gap in Cardano tooling for .NET developers, paving the way for broader blockchain adoption. Collaboration with the Demeter.Run team was invaluable, and I look forward to building on this momentum to further empower developers and enterprises within the Cardano ecosystem.
