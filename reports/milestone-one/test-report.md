## Introduction

**Purpose:**  
This report documents the testing process, findings, and outcomes for the OgmiosDotnetClient project. The objective is to ensure that the ChainSynchronizationClient and its core functionality for reading blockchain data from a specific point or origin meet the required standards to avoid regressions.

**Scope:**  
The tests cover the ChainSynchronizationClient and the functionality related to reading blockchain data from a specified point or origin.

**Audience:**  
This report is intended for reviewers and the community.

---

## Test Objectives

- Verify the ChainSynchronizationClient's ability to resume listening for WebSocket messages.
- Ensure queued WebSocket response messages are processed correctly.
- Validate the selection of the correct intersection point.
- Confirm error handling for specific scenarios, such as no intersection found.
- Verify the RollForward / RollBackward handlers are called correctly.

---

## Test Environment

**Software:**

- .NET SDK 9.0
- Moq Library for mocking.
- xUnit Framework for testing.

**Test Data:**

- Mocked data representing blockchain interaction points and messages.

---

## Test Scope

**In-Scope:**

- ChainSynchronizationClient's methods for resuming, queuing, and processing blockchain messages.
- Interaction with WebSocket and mock services.

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Integration testing with a live Ogmios server.

---

## Test Approach

**Methodology:**  
Unit testing was performed to validate the functionality of the `ChainSynchronizationClient`. Mocked WebSocket responses were used to simulate various scenarios, ensuring isolation and reproducibility of the tests.

**Test Levels:**

- Unit Testing

## Test Cases Executed

| **Test Case ID** | **Description**                                                                         | **Status** | **Priority** | **Remarks**                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| TC001            | Verify `ResumeListeningAsync` closes WebSocket on receiving a close message.            | Passed     | High         | WebSocket closed as expected.                    |
| TC002            | Verify WebSocket response messages are queued correctly.                                | Passed     | High         | Message correctly added to the queue.            |
| TC003            | Verify `ResumeListeningAsync` selects the tip as the intersection point.                | Passed     | Medium       | Tip successfully selected as intersection point. |
| TC004            | Verify `ResumeListeningAsync` throws exception when no intersection is found.           | Passed     | Medium       | Exception thrown as expected.                    |
| TC005            | Verify `ResumeListeningAsync` intersects at genesis when origin is provided as a point. | Passed     | Medium       | Correctly intersects at genesis.                 |
| TC006            | Verify `ProcessMessagesAsync` processes queued messages from WebSocket response.        | Passed     | Medium       | Correctly processes all queued messages.         |
| TC007            | Verify `ResumeListeningAsync` processes messages in correct order.                      | Passed     | High         | Messages processed in the correct sequence.      |
| TC008            | Verify `HandleNextBlockAsync` calls RollBackwardHandler when direction is backward.     | Passed     | Medium       | Correct handler called for backward direction.   |
| TC09             | Verify `HandleNextBlockAsync` calls RollForwardHandler when direction is forward.       | Passed     | Medium       | Correct handler called for forward direction.    |

## Test Results

**Summary:**

- Total Test Cases: 9
- Passed: 9
- Failed: 0

All test cases passed successfully, demonstrating that the `ChainSynchronizationClient` meets its functional requirements.

---

## Conclusion

The tests successfully verify the core functionality of the `ChainSynchronizationClient`, including its ability to process messages, select the appropriate intersection point, and handle errors appropriately. These tests cover the `ChainSynchronizationClient` and the core functionality of reading blockchain data from a specific point or origin.

No issues or regressions were found during testing.
